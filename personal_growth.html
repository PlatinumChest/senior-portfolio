                    <p>Building Resilience: My Evolution into a Systems Architect</p>
                </header>
                <div class="essay-broad">
                    <p>
                        For a long time, I saw technology as just a career—a field where I could work on interesting
                        systems, earn a stable income, and eventually "get out" when the job was done. My relationship
                        with my homelab was modular; I focused on solving individual problems without seeing the larger
                        picture. However, as I began my <strong>Integrated Systems Intensive</strong>, everything
                        changed. I realized that my interest wasn't in just maintaining systems for others, but in
                        becoming the architect behind the products themselves. This shift in mindset led me to embrace
                        the challenge of higher education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I intend to
                        master the intersection of hardware and software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This journey has already presented me with significant technical hurdles. My most challenging
                        project to date involved implementing persistent <span
                            style="color: #4eb980; font-weight: 600;">GPU passthrough</span> within a multi-node Proxmox
                        cluster. What began as a routine configuration turned into an exhaustive battle with the
                        hardware reset bug and IOMMU group isolation. I spent countless hours debugging kernel errors
                        and hardware-software collisions. This struggle taught me a vital lesson: building
                        enterprise-grade systems isn't just about code—it’s about the raw planning, physical labor, and
                        persistence required to make different technologies work in unison.
                    </p>



                    <p>
                        This technical grit was actually developed far from my server rack. I learned the value of <span
                            style="color: #4eb980; font-weight: 600;">patience and calm focus</span> on the snowmobile
                        trails, repairing my 1994 Arctic Cat EXT 580. When an engine fails in the cold, panic isn't an
                        option; you have to find the logic in the failure. I’ve carried this "don't panic" mentality
                        into my systems engineering, treating every server crash as a puzzle to be solved with the same
                        systematic focus I use for a physical engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work ethic is also rooted in my cultural heritage from Veracruz and Oaxaca. Watching the
                        perseverance of my family (Castellanos, Cruz, and Portugal) motivates me to build infrastructure
                        that is durable and resilient. This is further reinforced by my interest in urban exploration;
                        documenting the ruins of old industrial sites reminds me that engineering has a lifecycle, and
                        we must design our future systems to withstand the test of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I prepare for the rigors of UW-Madison, my goal is to master <strong>semiconductor
                            manufacturing</strong> and hardware-software integration. My path has taught me that I am
                        capable of architecting complex systems, and I am ready to transition from a student in a lab to
                        a professional architect shaping the future of technology.
