                    <p>From Student to Architect: The Foundry Sprint</p>
                </header>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                    For most of my life, I viewed technology as a transactional field—a place where I would enter, build something for a paycheck, and leave. However, over the last year, my perspective has undergone a radical transformation. I realized that remaining a "consumer" of technology, or even just a standard employee, was not enough. I wanted to be the architect. This shift led me to begin my "Foundry Sprint," a self-imposed period of intense learning where I am compressing a decade of technical growth into five years across six domains, including Cybersecurity and Computer Engineering.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                    This growth was forged through significant adversity. Recently, I hit a technical wall that tested my resolve: implementing kernel-level GPU passthrough for a Windows Virtual Machine in my 6-node Proxmox cluster. What appeared to be a simple software toggle turned into a grueling battle with the "GPU Reset Bug" and IOMMU group isolation. Day after day, I was met with black screens and system hangs. It was in these moments of frustration that I learned the true meaning of systems thinking. Building physical systems requires a level of planning and investment that a classroom can never truly replicate.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                    This challenge mirrored my experiences outside the lab. When repairing my 1994 Arctic Cat EXT 580, I have faced mechanical failures that could easily lead to panic. Instead, I learned to be patient. I realized that if something breaks, there is always a logical path to a fix. I applied this same "mechanical patience" to my server rack. These lessons in grit and systematic problem-solving are what ultimately convinced me to pursue a degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am no longer just looking for a tech job; I am building a legacy through Tolteca Systems, preparing for a future where I don't just use tools—I create them.
