                    <p>Growth Through Technical Complexity and Persistence</p>

                <div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <p>
                        Throughout my secondary education, I initially viewed technology as a practical vocational path—a means to build a stable career. However, as I began a rigorous five-year "Foundry Sprint" to master the intersection of multiple engineering disciplines, my perspective shifted toward large-scale systems architecture. I realized that my passion lies in creating the foundational infrastructure that powers modern computing. This shift from consumer to architect led me to establish Tolteca Systems, where I focus on bridging the gap between virtualization, security, and hardware performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This journey has been defined by overcoming significant technical adversity. While managing my enterprise-grade 6-node Proxmox and Ceph cluster, I encountered a major obstacle: implementing stable GPU passthrough for a Windows Virtual Machine. Navigating the complexities of IOMMU group isolation and hardware-level reset bugs required hundreds of hours of manual troubleshooting and system analysis. This experience taught me that true engineering excellence requires a balance of high-level theory and the willingness to engage in deep, persistent problem-solving. It reinforced that building reliable infrastructure is a commitment to long-term resilience over quick results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The discipline required to navigate these challenges was developed outside the lab, specifically through the mechanical maintenance of my 1994 Arctic Cat EXT 580. Troubleshooting mechanical failures in the field taught me that any system—whether mechanical or digital—can be understood and repaired through patient, systematic analysis. This "mechanical resilience" is now a core component of my professional work ethic. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My drive is further influenced by my family’s heritage from Veracruz and Oaxaca. The perseverance of my family members (Castellanos, Cruz, and Portugal) motivates me to build technology that is both durable and meaningful. Additionally, my interest in documenting abandoned industrial sites through urban exploration reminds me to consider the full lifecycle of the systems I design, ensuring they contribute to a sustainable technological future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I transition to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for Computer Engineering, I am eager to master semiconductor manufacturing and hardware-software integration. My multi-disciplinary background has prepared me for the rigors of university and the complexities of the tech industry, ensuring that my future as a systems architect is built on a foundation of integrity and innovation.
