                    <p>Defining My Path through Technical Adversity</p>
                </header>
                <div style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <p>
                        For much of my early education, I viewed technology as a transactional field—a practical domain where I could build skills to eventually secure a job. However, as I embarked on my "Foundry Sprint" to become a Tech Polymath, my perspective shifted from that of a student to an architect. I realized that I didn't just want to use the tools created by others; I wanted to build the infrastructure that empowers the next generation of users. This realization sparked my transition into entrepreneurship, leading to the development of Tolteca Systems and Project Itzli.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This period of growth was characterized by intense technical challenges. While managing my 6-node Proxmox and Ceph cluster, I encountered a significant hurdle: implementing reliable GPU passthrough for a Windows environment. What seemed like a routine configuration evolved into a complex troubleshooting process involving IOMMU group isolation and the "GPU Reset Bug". Navigating these system-level failures taught me that true engineering requires a balance of theoretical knowledge and the willingness to invest hundreds of hours into physical troubleshooting. It reinforced that building resilient systems is a marathon, not a sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The discipline to persevere through these setbacks was forged while performing mechanical repairs on my 1994 Arctic Cat EXT 580. Troubleshooting mechanical systems in difficult conditions taught me that any failure can be resolved through systematic, patient analysis. This "mechanical resilience" has become the foundation of my work in the lab. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work ethic is also deeply rooted in my heritage from Veracruz and Oaxaca. Seeing the perseverance of my family motivates me to build technology that is durable and impactful. Furthermore, my interest in urban exploration allows me to observe the long-term lifecycle of engineering, reminding me to build projects with future generations in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I prepare to enter the University of Wisconsin-Madison for Computer Engineering, I am focused on mastering semiconductor manufacturing and large-scale systems design. My "Foundry Sprint" has prepared me for the rigors of university and the challenges of the professional world, ensuring that my contributions to the field of technology will be both innovative and sustainable.
